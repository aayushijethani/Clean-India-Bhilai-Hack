# Clean-India-Bhilai-Hack
We all know the importance of cleanliness these days amid covid crisis. It's been a year and all we hear is wash/sanitize you hands, keep everything clean.
But only personal sanitization is not enough, surroundings should be clean too. We see a lot of garbage at the corners everywhere, small and tiny streets.
Keeping all that in mind we thought of making a website for Rajnandgaon where people can register a complaint about the trash, and it'll be cleaned asap. 
It will be a small initiative to help increase cleanliness in our surroundings which is beneficial in many ways.
Entire project is build using HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL, PHP.
